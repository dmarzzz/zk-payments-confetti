# The UNLINK game (task B3; Spec.md §7 T4)

The challenge-terminated spend-unlinkability game, for an abstract scheme
interface (`UnlinkScheme`). This file is DEFINITIONS ONLY: the T4 theorem
(and its B-static/B-rerand calibration pair) is a later workstream gated
on human review of these definitions. Every definition's docstring
restates its Spec.md T4 clause; encoding deviations are marked
`GATE-NOTE:` and collected in `README-games.md`.

## Game shape (Spec.md T4, clause by clause)

1. The challenger samples the hidden bit `b ← {0,1}` **at game start**
   (`unlinkGame` binds `b` first; rev-1 repair — the advantage is
   well-defined on every path, ⊥-paths contribute exactly 1/2).
2. `Setup` runs and two honest candidate payers `P₀, P₁` are created,
   equal deposits, opened in batch: the adversary first supplies the
   genesis inputs (`phase0` — in B it is the issuer of the genesis
   receipts, M2), then two draws of `S.openCh` run before any oracle
   query; the public open transcripts (`OpenView`) are handed to the
   adversary's interactive phase.
3. The adversary plays the payee (all `N` gateways, all payee keys); its
   **pre-challenge oracles** are `unlinkSpec`: `spend(u, m)`, `retry(u)`,
   `serve(u, ρ)` (its accept-and-serve response; withholding it is the
   abort lever), `close(u)`, and `tick` (epoch advance). Corrupt payers
   have no interaction surface with the candidates (Spec.md: "maximality
   at zero cost"), so they are not modeled — the adversary simulates them
   internally.
4. **Challenge and termination (session form, rev-9 — from the K4
   external review)**: `phase1` *ends by returning* the challenge
   message **vector** `m*₁..m*_q : List S.M`, `q ≥ 1` of the adversary's
   choice. The game checks, at challenge time, epoch-freshness
   (`epochFresh`: neither candidate emitted a signal in the current
   epoch — unchanged) and challenge-capability **for `q`**
   (`challengeCapable … q`: both candidates unclosed and solvent for `q`
   more spends). On failure the adversary receives `⊥` (`none`) —
   in-band data, not game failure; both checks test *both* candidates,
   so `⊥`-vs-ticket is `b`-independent. On success `P_b` emits the whole
   batch at its next `q` indices (`spendBatch`), all at the current
   epoch `e*` — sharing the session pseudonym `nf_{e*}`, structurally:
   the batch runs atomically at `g.epoch` with no oracle interleaving —
   and the adversary receives the ticket list. **The game then ends**:
   the adversary's `guess` is a pure function of its retained memory and
   the challenge response — no oracle access after the challenge, by
   type (`ChalAdversary`). In particular the three world-observable
   components rev-1's gate found leaky (the retry buffer, the index
   counters, close events) are reachable only through the pre-challenge
   oracle surface. Why the session form (rev-9): `q = 1` certified only
   *first-spend-per-epoch* unlinkability — a scheme leaking a persistent
   cross-epoch tag only on second-and-later spends within an epoch
   passed the `q = 1` game while being lifetime-linkable under normal
   fleet usage; with the session challenge such a tag surfaces inside
   the batch and matches the pre-challenge transcript. What is certified
   is whole-epoch-session unlinkability; within-session linkage via
   `nf_{e*}` remains by design (MC6).
5. Advantage: `|Pr[b' = b] − 1/2|` (`unlinkAdvantage := guessGap`).

**GATE-OBLIGATION (M1):** instances whose `View` drops the zk proof `π`
(and `root`, `e`) do not exercise NIZK-ZK at the definition level; the
per-instance T4 proof must discharge `zkBridgeObligation` (end of file)
between the full-ticket instance and the proof-free instance. -/

/-! ## The abstract scheme interface -/

/-- What the UNLINK game needs from a payment-channel instantiation: the
adversary-visible content of the candidates' emissions and the candidate
payer state evolution. Instantiation A (flat-ticket RLN) and both B
variants (B-static / B-rerand) are intended instances; the B-static
calibration attack of Spec.md T4 lives entirely in how an instance
populates `View`.

GATE-NOTE: `Open` is folded into the sampling `openCh`, which takes the
**adversary-supplied** `GenesisInput` (M2: in B the genesis receipt is
payee-issued, i.e. adversary-issued) and produces the public transcript
`OpenView`. Later receipt issuance routes through `serve`. Fully
interactive `Open` is still not modeled — the adversary's entire
contribution to `Open` is its `GenesisInput`. -/
structure UnlinkScheme : Type 1 where
  /-- gateway-bound spend messages `m` (Spec.md §1, MC14) -/
  M : Type
  /-- adversary-visible content of one spend ticket: the epoch pseudonym
  `nf_e`, the signal `(x, y, nf)`, and — for instantiation B — the
  presented certified-ciphertext form.

  **GATE-OBLIGATION (M1, impossible to miss):** an instance may populate
  `View` proof-free, but that does NOT discharge zero-knowledge by
  itself — dropping `π` at the definition level is exactly the K2 smell
  Spec.md §5 bans. The instance's T4 proof must state its headline for a
  full-ticket instance (`View` = the wire ticket including `π`, `root`,
  `e`) and discharge `zkBridgeObligation` (end of this file, naming
  assumption 2 of `Zkpc.Assumptions`) down to the proof-free instance. -/
  View : Type
  /-- adversary-visible content of a candidate's public close event
  (Spec.md §2 Close, MC20 [rev-6/7] — **no close signal exists in either
  instantiation**). A (close-by-unused-enumeration): the close publishes
  `(cm_u, U, π_close)`, `U` the PRF-fresh revealed nullifiers of the
  claimed-unused indices — `CloseView` must carry `cm_u` and `U` (hence
  `|U|`, i.e. the spend count, the MC15 leak T4 does not cover). B
  (certified-count close): the close publishes `(cm_u, j, nf_j, π_close)`
  — `CloseView` must carry `cm_u`, the certified count `j`, and the
  revealed `nf_j` of the first index beyond it.

  **GATE-OBLIGATION (O4, rev-9/K4 Concern 2):** because the game
  terminates at the challenge, close-time content is outside its view —
  every instance owes `closeViewSimulatable` (end of this file): its
  close output is simulatable from `(cm, spend count)` alone. -/
  CloseView : Type
  /-- public transcript of one `Open` (candidate creation) -/
  OpenView : Type
  /-- adversary-supplied input to a candidate's `Open` (M2): in
  instantiation B the genesis receipt (`ct₀`, its signature) is issued by
  the payee — i.e. by the adversary — so it enters the game as an
  adversary choice (`UnlinkAdversary.phase0`), not a challenger sample.
  `PUnit` for instantiation A (no payee-supplied `Open` component). -/
  GenesisInput : Type
  /-- data the adversary supplies when it accepts-and-serves a spend:
  instantiation B's refund receipt `ρ = (ct', σ_S(ct'), r', c)`; `PUnit`
  in instantiation A (accept has no payer-visible effect there). -/
  Receipt : Type
  /-- candidate payer private state: index counter, refund state (`R` and
  its certified opening in B), retry buffer -/
  PSt : Type
  /-- `Open` with deposit `D` at batch time, against an
  adversary-supplied genesis input (M2): initial payer state plus the
  public open transcript. Both candidates draw from this one function,
  which encodes "equal deposits, opened in batch at the same time".
  GATE-NOTE: total — the instance absorbs a malformed genesis input on
  the honest-payer side (e.g. as a state that never becomes solvent,
  hence never challenge-capable); sabotaging one candidate's genesis is
  one more route to shrinking the capable set, charged to the anonymity
  set like every other abort lever. -/
  openCh : GenesisInput → ProbComp (PSt × OpenView)
  /-- `Spend` at the current epoch: emit the ticket at the candidate's
  next index (consumption at emission, MC2) and advance the state;
  `none` iff the solvency conjunct is unsatisfiable at the current index
  (Spec.md §2 — "if `Spend` outputs ⊥ on insolvency, A is told so"). -/
  spend : ℕ → PSt → M → ProbComp (Option (View × PSt))
  /-- the MC2 retry buffer: the last emitted ticket, re-sent bit-identical
  (`none` if nothing was emitted yet). Read-only. -/
  lastTicket : PSt → Option View
  /-- apply an adversary-issued receipt to the candidate's refund state
  (B: grows `R` if the receipt validates; A: no-op).
  GATE-NOTE: total — an invalid receipt must be absorbed as a no-op by
  the instance; receipt validation failure is not a game event. -/
  serve : PSt → Receipt → PSt
  /-- `Close` at the current epoch (MC20 semantics — see `CloseView`):
  produce the public close event and the final payer state. A: assemble
  the unused-enumeration `(cm, U, π_close)` — **no signal is emitted**,
  the revealed nullifiers are PRF-fresh values never seen on any wire;
  B: assemble `(cm, j, nf_j, π_close)` at the certified count. The `ℕ`
  argument is the current epoch, available to instances whose close
  artifacts are epoch-dependent. -/
  close : ℕ → PSt → ProbComp (CloseView × PSt)
  /-- the solvency half of challenge-capability, parameterized by the
  session length `q` (rev-9 session form): the candidate is solvent for
  `q` more spends under its current certified state — A: `(j+q)·C ≤ D`
  for next index `j`; B: `(j+q)·C_max ≤ D + R` against the receipts
  held (Spec.md T4, challenge clause in session form). -/
  capableFor : ℕ → PSt → Bool

/-! ## Oracle surface -/

/-- Pre-challenge oracle queries of the UNLINK game (Spec.md T4). The two
candidates are addressed as `u : Bool` (`false = P₀`, `true = P₁`).

The abort/evict powers of Spec.md T4 need no dedicated index: aborting an
interaction is the adversary *not* issuing the `serve` query for a
delivered ticket (the payee's accept/abort choice; in B this withholds
the refund receipt and can drive a candidate insolvent — the concrete
abort lever), and eviction is refusing all further service to a candidate
(never serving it again). The generic `withEvict` wrapper of
`Zkpc.Games.Framework` exists for games that need an explicit eviction
switch; UNLINK's eviction power is native to its oracle surface. -/
inductive UnlinkOp (S : UnlinkScheme) : Type
  /-- `Ospend(u, m)`: `P_u` runs `Spend` on gateway-bound `m` at its next
  index; the ticket (or insolvency-⊥) is delivered to the adversary -/
  | spend (u : Bool) (m : S.M)
  /-- `Oretry(u)`: `P_u` re-sends its last emitted ticket unchanged (MC2) -/
  | retry (u : Bool)
  /-- the adversary accepts a delivered ticket and serves: hands `P_u` its
  receipt data (B: the refund receipt; A: `PUnit`) -/
  | serve (u : Bool) (ρ : S.Receipt)
  /-- `Oclose(u)`: directs `P_u` to close; the public close event is
  delivered (MC20: A reveals `(cm_u, U)` — unused-nullifier enumeration;
  B reveals `(cm_u, j, nf_j)` — certified count plus one fresh
  nullifier; **no signal is emitted by a close** in either
  instantiation) -/
  | close (u : Bool)
  /-- advance the epoch clock.
  GATE-NOTE: epochs are an abstract adversary-advanced counter. In the
  deployed protocol epochs advance with wall-clock time under scheduler
  control; Spec.md §6 gives the adversary the scheduler, so an explicit
  epoch-advance oracle is the faithful (maximal-power) encoding. -/
  | tick

/-- Response types of the UNLINK oracles. `Option` responses are the
in-band game-⊥ of `Zkpc.Games.Framework` (`botSpec` convention): `none`
is data the adversary receives, never computation failure. -/

/-! ## Challenger state and oracle handler -/

/-- Challenger-side game state: the epoch clock, both candidates' scheme
states, close flags, and the epoch of each candidate's most recent signal
emission (for the challenge-time freshness predicate — a transcript
predicate, per rev-2 NEW-5, so the *game* tracks it, not the scheme). -/
structure GSt (S : UnlinkScheme) : Type where
  /-- current epoch `e` (starts at 0, advanced only by `tick`) -/
  epoch : ℕ
  /-- candidate payer states, indexed by `u` -/
  cand : Bool → S.PSt
  /-- whether `P_u` has closed -/
  closed : Bool → Bool
  /-- epoch of `P_u`'s most recent signal emission (`none` = never).
  Because the epoch clock is monotone, "`P_u` emitted a signal during the
  current epoch" is exactly `lastSig u = some epoch`. -/
  lastSig : Bool → Option ℕ

/-- Initial game state from the two candidates' opened states. -/
def GSt.init (S : UnlinkScheme) (p₀ p₁ : S.PSt) : GSt S where
  epoch := 0
  cand := fun u => if u then p₁ else p₀
  closed := fun _ => false
  lastSig := fun _ => none

/-- The pre-challenge oracle handler (the UNLINK "world" — the same world
for both values of the hidden bit; only the challenge depends on `b`).
Per query:

* `spend u m`: if `P_u` closed, respond `⊥` (GATE-NOTE: Spec.md leaves
  spends directed at a closed candidate implicit; a closed payer emits
  nothing, so `⊥` — the adversary closed it and knows). Otherwise run
  `S.spend`; on a ticket, record the emission epoch (freshness clock) and
  the advanced state; on insolvency-`none`, deliver `⊥` ("A is told so").
* `retry u`: deliver the retry buffer, bit-identical, with **no** state
  change and **no** freshness update. GATE-NOTE: a bit-identical re-send
  is not a new signal — it carries the original epoch's pseudonym — so it
  does not count as "emitted a signal during e*" for the challenge-time
  freshness predicate. GATE-NOTE: retry is answered even after close
  (strictly more adversary power; a closed candidate is
  challenge-incapable regardless).
* `serve u ρ`: apply the receipt to `P_u`'s refund state (no-op once
  closed). The accept/abort choice of Spec.md T4 is exactly:
  issue this query, or don't.
* `close u`: run `P_u`'s close (once; repeated closes respond `⊥`),
  deliver the public close event, mark the candidate closed. GATE-NOTE
  (MC20): the close emits **no signal** (A publishes the
  unused-enumeration `U`, B the certified count + `nf_j`; the reveals
  are PRF-fresh values, not line points), so the handler's `lastSig`
  update at close is a **conservative no-op**: the only executions in
  which that entry could flip the freshness predicate have the candidate
  closed — and a closed candidate already fails `challengeCapable`, so
  the challenge is `⊥` on exactly the same executions with or without
  the update. It is retained purely so `lastSig` over-approximates
  "emitted anything in this epoch"; behavior is unchanged.
* `tick`: advance the epoch. -/

/-! ## Challenge-time predicates and the challenge move -/

/-- **Epoch-freshness at challenge time** (Spec.md T4, rev-2 NEW-5): a
predicate on the transcript, checked when the challenge arrives — neither
candidate has emitted any signal during the current epoch `e*`. Without
it the game is trivially winnable via the shared epoch pseudonym `nf_e`
against every scheme (Spec.md T4 anti-vacuity (ii)). -/
def epochFresh (S : UnlinkScheme) (g : GSt S) : Bool :=
  !(g.lastSig false == some g.epoch) && !(g.lastSig true == some g.epoch)

/-- **Challenge-capability for `q`** (Spec.md T4, session form rev-9):
both candidates are open, unslashed, unclosed, and solvent for `q` more
spends under their current certified state. Encoded: unclosed (`closed`
flag) and solvent-for-`q` (`S.capableFor q`).
GATE-NOTE: "open" holds by construction (both candidates
are opened at setup and there is no eviction-from-the-tree oracle), and
"unslashed" reduces to true — no UNLINK oracle can slash an honest
candidate (producing slash evidence against an honest payer is exactly
the FRAME game, T7). A candidate the adversary evicted into insolvency
fails `capableFor`, shrinking the capable set — the game charges that to
the anonymity set, not the scheme (the calibrated content of the abort
attack). Proof-order note (Mi2): Spec.md §7's proof order runs
single-signal-exculpability → … → T4 → T7-as-stated, with the
exculpability lemma (all-`N`-corrupt FRAME, T3's second clause)
established *before* T4 — so reading "unslashed" as vacuous here
introduces no circularity. -/
def challengeCapable (S : UnlinkScheme) (g : GSt S) (q : ℕ) : Bool :=
  (!(g.closed false) && S.capableFor q (g.cand false)) &&
  (!(g.closed true) && S.capableFor q (g.cand true))

/-- Emit the challenge session: `P_b`'s tickets for `m*₁..m*_q` at its
next `q` indices, all at the fixed epoch `e` — no oracle runs between
the batch's spends, so the whole session shares `nf_e` structurally. If
any spend in the batch returns `none`, the adversary receives `⊥` for
the whole session (see the Mi3 obligation on `challengeResp`: under
`capableFor q` this cannot happen for faithful instances). -/
def spendBatch (S : UnlinkScheme) (e : ℕ) :

      match ← S.spend e st m with
      | none => pure none
      | some (v, st') => (Option.map (v :: ·)) <$> spendBatch S e st' ms

/-- The challenge move (session form, rev-9): on the checks failing, the
adversary receives `⊥` (in-band `none`). Otherwise `P_b` emits the
challenge session `t*₁..t*_q` for the vector `m*₁..m*_q` at its next `q`
indices in the current epoch, and the adversary receives exactly the
ticket views — the advanced state of `P_b` is discarded, which is the
structural form of "the game then ends" (no bit-dependent continuation
exists to observe; MC15). GATE-NOTE: Spec.md types the vector `q ≥ 1`;
an empty vector is answered `⊥` (checked on both candidates' behalf
before `b` is consulted, so it is `b`-independent like every other
`⊥`-path).

GATE-OBLIGATION (Mi3, per instance, session form): if the checks pass
but some spend of the batch still returns `none`, the adversary receives
`⊥`. The branch exists because the abstract interface cannot forbid it;
each instance's T4 proof must either show the branch is dead
(`capableFor q (g.cand b) = true` implies all `q` spends of the batch
succeed — the faithful reading: solvent for `q` more spends) or account
for its probability explicitly in the advantage bound. -/

/-! ## The game -/

/-- A UNLINK adversary (M2, two stages before the pure guess):

* `phase0`: before `Setup` produces any candidate, the adversary — as
  the payee, the issuer of B's genesis receipts — chooses the genesis
  inputs for both candidates (possibly randomized), retaining memory
  `Aux0`. A-instances have `GenesisInput = PUnit` and `phase0` is
  trivial there.
* `main`: the challenge-terminated core (`Zkpc.Games.ChalAdversary`):
  the interactive pre-challenge phase receives `Aux0` and the public
  open transcripts, ends by emitting the challenge message **vector**
  `m*₁..m*_q` (session form, rev-9); the final guess is a pure function
  of retained memory and the (`⊥`-capable) session response. -/

  /-- memory carried from the genesis stage into the interactive phase -/
  Aux0 : Type
  /-- genesis stage: the adversary-payee's `Open` inputs for `P₀, P₁` -/
  phase0 : ProbComp ((S.GenesisInput × S.GenesisInput) × Aux0)

/-- **The UNLINK game** (Spec.md §7 T4, challenge-terminated). In order:

1. `b ← {0,1}` — sampled first, so the advantage is well-defined on every
   path and `⊥`-paths contribute exactly 1/2 (rev-1 repair).
2. The adversary's genesis stage picks both `Open` inputs (M2 — in B it
   is the genesis-receipt issuer); both candidates then open in batch
   with equal deposits (two draws of `S.openCh`); the adversary's
   interactive phase gets its genesis memory and the public open
   transcripts.
3. The interactive phase runs against the pre-challenge oracles
   (`unlinkImpl`), ending with the challenge message vector `m*₁..m*_q`
   (session form, rev-9).
4. The challenge move (`challengeResp`): freshness + capability-for-`q`
   checks, then `P_b`'s session of `q` ticket views or `⊥`.
5. The game ends; the adversary's pure `guess` produces `b'`, and the
   game outputs the win indicator `b = b'`. -/

/-! ## The NIZK-ZK bridging obligation (M1) -/

/-- **GATE-OBLIGATION (M1): the NIZK-ZK bridge the T4 prover must
discharge per instance.** `Sfull` is the instance whose `View` is the
real wire ticket — `π`, `root`, `e`, `nf_e`, the signal, and (B) the
presented ciphertext; `Sfree` is the proof-free instance actually
analyzed. The obligation: every adversary against the full-ticket game
is matched, up to the instance's zero-knowledge distinguishing advantage
`εZK` (assumption 2 of `Zkpc.Assumptions` — NIZK zero-knowledge; the
simulator replaces `π` by a proofless simulated view), by an adversary
against the proof-free game. Discharging this with the instance's `εZK`
and then bounding `Sfree`'s advantage yields T4 for the *real* ticket,
closing the K2 smell of dropping `π` at the definition level.

Disposition of the non-`π` dropped components, to be argued inside the
discharge: `root` and the current epoch `e` are **common to both
candidates and adversary-computable** (both candidates sit under the
same membership root, and the epoch is the `tick` count the adversary
itself controls), so a reduction can reinsert them into any proof-free
view without knowing `b` — dropping them loses nothing. `nf_e` is NOT
droppable (it is the epoch-linkability surface the freshness predicate
exists for) and must remain in `Sfree.View`. -/

/-! ## The CloseView-simulatability obligation (O4) -/

/-- **GATE-OBLIGATION (O4, rev-9 — K4 Concern 2, MC15): CloseView is
simulatable from `(cm, spend count)` alone.** Because the UNLINK game
terminates at the challenge, close-time content is outside its view; the
theorem is honest about that scope only if the close cannot leak more
than the game's stated residue — the identity `cm` and the spend count
(the MC15 side channel). The obligation: the instance names how its
payer state determines the close's public summary (`Cm`, `cm`, `count` —
supplied by the instance, since the abstract interface does not expose
them) and exhibits a simulator producing the close-output distribution
from that summary and the public epoch alone.

Both in-scope closes satisfy it (Spec.md MC15): A's `U` and B's `nf_j`
are PRF-fresh values determined in distribution by the count (and `cm`);
a hypothetical close publishing *used* nullifiers — total retroactive
deanonymization — is exactly what no simulator can produce, so this
obligation excludes it.

Stated over **all** payer states for simplicity; an instance may
discharge it over game-reachable states only, recording that weakening
at its own gate entry. -/

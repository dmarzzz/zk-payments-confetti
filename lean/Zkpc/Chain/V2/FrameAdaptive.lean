# Non-frameability, stage 2: the adaptive shared-oracle bound (obligation 3)

`Zkpc/Chain/V2/Frame.lean` bounded a *static* framing adversary (a fixed
probe list). This module upgrades to the **adaptive** adversary the T7
campaign required: Bob chooses each chain-secret probe from the history of
previous hit/miss replies, and does so against the *fixed* honest chain
secret `c` committed at open. That is exactly VCV-io's hidden-target
adaptive read game (`OracleComp.hiddenReadMany`): the secret is drawn once
and hidden until the first hit, so the adaptive strategy's read points are
fixed by the all-miss history and the firing probability is the union
bound `q · (1/|C|)` (`probEvent_hiddenReadMany_le`).

This is the analogue for the chain of what `fsProgramCollisionBound`
(`Zkpc/Crypto/FSRom.lean`) did for the Fiat–Shamir programmed slot, reused
verbatim: same hidden-target lemma, chain secret in place of the programmed
challenge. Combined with the fresh-uniform target of the honest close
(`Zkpc/Chain/V2/CollisionBound.lean`'s lazy-RO model), an adaptive `q`-probe
framer's total advantage is at most `q/|C| + 1/|N|` — the stage-1 bound of
`Frame.lean`, now with the probe list replaced by a genuine adaptive
strategy.

Scope note (carried from `FSRom.lean`): like the stage-1 kernel and the FS
programming loss, this is a standalone hidden-target bound. Fusing it with
the payment/close oracle semantics into one adaptive experiment with a
common programmable oracle — the last mile the rev-11 T7 stack reached only
via the `FrameDeferred*`/`FrameComplete` deferred-sampling apparatus — is
the residual, tracked in `ROADMAP.md` as the deferred-sampling port and not
claimed here.

/-- **Adaptive chain-secret probing** (Spec-v2 §7 non-frameability, the
adaptive core of stage 2): the honest chain secret `c ← C` is drawn once at
open; an adaptive `q`-probe strategy `σ` (each probe chosen from the
hit/miss history of the parent-reveal hash queries) recovers it — the
`c ∈ probes` disjunct of `Frame.lean`, now genuinely adaptive — with
probability at most `q/|C|`. Direct instance of
`OracleComp.probEvent_hiddenReadMany_le` at the uniform secret. -/

/-- **Adaptive secret probe plus a direct target guess** (Spec-v2 §7, the
two hidden-target terms of stage 2). **This is not a single fused game**:
the two probabilities live in disjoint experiments (the adaptive probe run
`hiddenReadMany`, and an independent uniform target draw), and their sum is
stated only as the two terms that a *fused* adaptive frame game would union
to. Fusing them into one adaptive experiment with a common programmable
oracle — so that `q/|C| + q_N/|N|` bounds one win predicate — is exactly the
FrameDeferred deferred-sampling port, the acknowledged stage-2 residual;
this lemma does not claim it. The static fused game is `Frame.lean`'s
`chainFrame_bound`; what stage 2 adds is only the adaptive upgrade of the
secret-probe term (`adaptive_secret_probe_bound`). -/
